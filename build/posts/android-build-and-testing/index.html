  <p>Shimi Paperfish is designed to run on phones and tablets, so it's probably a good idea to get a version of the game running on phones as soon as possible to check that the game works, and also that it's actually fun.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we've now got Shimi running on Android!</p>

    <img src="/img/shimipaperfish-fishing2.png" alt="Fishing" />
</div>
<p>As you can see from the screenshots, we've added an overworld map so you can choose where to go fishing (this is just a placeholder image at the moment though!), with the idea that there will be several areas where different fish are prevalent.</p>
<p>Building for phones was really useful since it brought to light a number of things which aren't obvious when developing on a laptop. For instance, on phones the progress bar in the fishing screen disappears off the side of the screen, and a number of UI elements are far too small, despite everything seeming fine on laptops. Creating a phone version as early as possible means we can fix these things as we go, rather than having a huge backlog of work later on.</p>
<p>We also ran into problems when building for Android - it turns out there was a bug when using Unity and newer versions of the Android SDK. The fix for this involved upgrading the version of Unity, which is always risky mid-project! Luckily the upgrade didn't cause any problems and fixed the issue we had with Android, which was a relief.</p>
<p>As the project is still in early development, there are no public builds yet - hopefully there will be some time soon!</p>
